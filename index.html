        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
            <li>If there are three elements nested inside of a "body" element, those three nested elements are knows as child elements.</li>
            <li>The element that holds tall the children - in this case the "body" element - is knowns as the parent element.</li>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tab and a closing tab.</li>
            <li>The words "element" and "tag" are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference.</li>
            <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
            <li>Whereas tag refers only to what appears inside the angle body brackets.</li>
            <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies.</li>
            <li>Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>The "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The "href" attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The "href" attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model: every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attribute to which the rules, or declaration, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declaration contains two important components - the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Ex: the declaration color:blue; indicates the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet: the most common way to style a webpage. This is the preferred method because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a spearate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A variable is a name container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>Array: a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <li>The location of data in an array is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
            <li>Use ".length" to get the length or to access the length of an array.</li>
            <li>Events: are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response.</li>
            <li>The "alert()" function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what mesage to display.</li>
            <li>Arguments: a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.</li>
            <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code.</li>
            <li>Conditionals: are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A common conditional is the if...else statement</li>
            <li>Data Types: String, number, boolean, array and object.</li>
            <li>String: is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks.</li>
            <li>Number: is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
            <li>Boolean: is a true or false value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
            <li>Array: is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
            <li>Object: can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
