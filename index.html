        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the vbisible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elemnts are called child elements.</li>
            <li>If there are three elements nested inside of a "body" element, those three nested elements are knows as child elements.</li>
            <li>The element that holds tall the children - in this case the "body" element - is knowns as the parent element.</li>
            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tab and a closing tab.</li>
            <li>The words "element" and "tag" are commonly used interchangeably in the web development world, but it is important to know the difference.</li>
            <li>An element referes to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag.</li>
            <li>Whereas tag refers only to what appears inside the angle body brackets.</li>
            <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies.</li>
            <li>Alt text can also improve search engine rankings for your website.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>The "rel" attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The "href" attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The "href" attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location.</li>
          <li>CSS Box Model: every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outisde the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attribute to which the rules, or declaration, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declaration contains two important components - the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. Ex: the declaration color:blue; indicates the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheet: the most common way to stype a webpage. This is the preferred method because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a spearate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
